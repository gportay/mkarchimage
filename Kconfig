config HAVE_ROOT_PARTITION
	bool "Root Partition"
	help
	  Any native, optionally in LUKS.
	  
	  On systems with matching architecture, the first partition with this
	  type UUID on the disk containing the active EFI ESP is automatically
	  mounted to the root directory /. If the partition is encrypted with
	  LUKS or has dm-verity integrity data (see below), the device mapper
	  file will be named /dev/mapper/root.

config ROOT_PARTITION_SIZE

	  VFAT
	  
	  The ESP used for the current boot is automatically mounted to /efi/
	  (or /boot/ as fallback), unless a different partition is mounted
	  there (possibly via /etc/fstab, or because the Extended Boot Loader
	  Partition — see below — exists) or the directory is non-empty on the
	  root disk. This partition type is defined by the UEFI Specification.

config EFI_SYSTEM_PARTITION_SIZE
	string "EFI System Partition Size"
	default "260M"
	depends on HAVE_EFI_SYSTEM_PARTITION
	help
	  Specify the partition size in sectors. The number may be followed by

	  Typically VFAT
	  
	  The Extended Boot Loader Partition (XBOOTLDR) used for the current
	  boot is automatically mounted to /boot/, unless a different partition
	  is mounted there (possibly via /etc/fstab) or the directory is
	  non-empty on the root disk. This partition type is defined by the
	  Boot Loader Specification.

config EXTENDED_BOOT_LOADER_PARTITION_SIZE
